# Weather App in React

### This is an app built from the React weather app course on FreeCodeCamp. The course was created by Nishant Kumar. 


### I started a version of a React weather app in January, setting aside a limited amount of time for it before needing to work on another project. Then my dog, Coli, suddenly died of cancer. So I put this off for a bit. Now I've gone back and created the project from scratch using the Kumar's course. So I named the app after Coli. He and my other dog, Fiona, were my constant companions during my coding bootcamp, with Coli often interrupting my presentations to the class by barking at something that wasn't really a threat. He is missed greatly, especially when I'm coding.
