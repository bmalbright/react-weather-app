# Weather App in React

### This is an app built from the weather app course on FreeCodeCamp 


### So when I started this, I set aside some time for it and had gotten the basic code in before trying to really refactor it for the weather app. That is about the time Coli the dog got sick and I had to say goodbye. Might return to this. Might not. But if you happen to be looking at this and wonder why I didn't finish it, that's why.
