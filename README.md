# Weather App in React

### This app is a re-rendering of the weather app I completed for a homework assignment during coding bootcamp. I am building it in React. I am using starter code from on another assignment (a book search app) from bootcamp that used React and refactoring with the code from my weather app. The apps are similar enough and different enough that I thought it would be good coding practice. 

## Source codes

### The original weather app I created was for homework 6. It can be found here:

### The book seach app that I used as a React framework for this is the solved homework for section 21, the MERN section. The repo for bootcamp can be found here:
